A barebone email client (with GUI) that allows user to send plain text emails. Wrote it while I was studying SMTP protocol. Tested and verified functionality with my unversity email service.

Lookup your mail server's name using commands like nslookup. It is needed to fill up the "Local mailserver" field.

Note: Does not use any authentication scheme, so some email service might reject to send or send while marking it as a phishing email message. Plus, this brings about some interesting possible usage for this program, which I will let you find out yourself :)
